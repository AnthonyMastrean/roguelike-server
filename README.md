# Roguelike Server

A roguelike SSH server so I can be a bigger nerd!

## Getting Started

Clone this repository. Start the Vagrant development machine. The development packages, gems, and other tools should install automatically. The game packages will be built and dropped into `/vagrant/packages` (mapped to `/tmp/packages`).

```
$ vagrant up
```

SSH into the server.

```
$ vagrant ssh server
```
